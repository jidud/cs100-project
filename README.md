 > Authors: [Jenny Lee](https://github.com/jidud), [Avnish Kovi](https://github.com/Avikovi), [Shelby Wong](https://github.com/ShelbyMitsuko), [Zifeng Lei](https://github.com/Zifeng-Lei)

## Project Description
#### General description
In this program, movies are going to be organized into their respective categories based on genre. Given a movie, the progam will be able to recommend a list of films similar to the movie that was provided.
<!-- > Your project description should summarize the project you are proposing. Be sure to include:
 > * Why is it important or interesting to you? -->
#### Why is it important
This project is important because the topic was interesting and it seemed fun to code a movie recommender. Most people waste time browsing streaming sites trying to find a movie that they may like, however, this program cuts off that time searching by automatically giving them a list of movies, hence saving large amounts of time. In this project, movies will be categorized into their respective genres.

 <!-- > * What languages/tools/technologies do you plan to use? (This list may change over the course of the project) -->
#### Languages/tools/technologies
C++ - This project will be programmed in c++

CMake - This will be used to compile the program

googletest (gtest) - This will be used for unit testing

Git - This will use for performing version control

GitHub - This will use as a web-based Git repository
 <!-- > * What will be the input/output of your project? -->
#### Input/Output
Input - This project will pre input a certain number of movies along with their respective genres, elements, rating, etc. For users, the input for this project can be a specific genre or subgenre of movies, or a combination of multiple tags or criteria. The input can also be the name of a certain movie. This project can also input sorting criteria.

Output - The output of this project is a list of movies, which can be based on the input genre or the combination of labels. The list of movies can also contain movies that are similar in genre, elements, and other aspects to the input movie. The movie list output can be sorted based on the input criteria.

 <!-- > * What are the features that the project provides? -->
#### Project features
 <!-- > This description should be in enough detail that the TA/instructor can determine the complexity of the project and if it is sufficient for the team members to complete in the time allotted. -->
In this project, movies will be sorted and categorized into their respective genres. The program will display movies using under certain genres/subgenres. A user will be able to provide a name of a movie and the application will return a list of movies that are similar to the provided movie.

 > ## Phase II
 <!-- > In addition to completing the "User Interface Specification" and "Class Diagram" sections below, you will need to:
 > * Create an "Epic" (note) for each feature. Place these epics in the `Product Backlog` column
 > * Complete your first *sprint planning* meeting to plan out the next 7 days of work.
 >   * Break down the "Epics" into smaller actionable user stories (i.e. smaller development tasks). Convert them into issues and assign them to team members. Place these in the `TODO` column.
 >   * These cards should represent roughly 7 days worth of development time for your team. Then, once the sprint is over you should be repeating these steps to plan a new sprint, taking you until your second scrum meeting with the reader in phase III.
 > * Schedule two check-ins using Calendly. You need to pick both time slots during your lab on week 6. Your entire team must be present for both check-ins.
 >   * The first check-in needs to be scheduled with your lab TA. During that meeting, you will discuss your project design/class diagram from phase II.
 >   * The second check-in should be scheduled with a reader. During that meeting you will discuss:
 >     * The tasks you are planning for the first sprint
 >     * How work will be divided between the team members -->
## User Interface Specification
 <!-- > Include a navigation diagram for your screens and the layout of each of those screens as desribed below. For all the layouts/diagrams, you can use any tool such as PowerPoint or a drawing program. (Specification requirement is adapted from [this template](https://redirect.cs.umbc.edu/~mgrass2/cmsc345/Template_UI.doc)) -->

### Navigation Diagram
![Navigation diagram](ImageFiles/navigation_diagram.png)

The diagram above gives a basic guideline to our screen layout. From the menu, we would be able to search a movie based on genre, name/title, and/or by actor/director. There will be a filter tab where we would be able to include/exclude and sort out the movies based on sub-genres, name/title, date/year, actor/director, and rating. After all choices are chosen the user would able to "enter" and get a movie recommended by their choice.

### Screen Layouts
<!-- /*> Include the layout of each of your screens. The layout should describe the screenâ€™s major components such as menus and prompts for user inputs, expected output, and buttons (if applicable). Explain what is on the layout, and the purpose of each menu item, button, etc. If many screens share the same layout, start by describing the general layout and then list the screens that will be using that layout and the differences between each of them.*/ -->

This is the layout of each of our screens ([here](https://lucid.app/lucidchart/a003f8a0-d5a4-4db0-b977-7398b10bc704/edit?beaconFlowId=7003D2A67BF28FE0&invitationId=inv_c3e23e90-8755-4936-a625-4f5f18f1564d&page=Z5eWzkaaxa7b#)).

Main menu: The user will first see the main menu. The two design modes we will use for this project are getting movie recommendations by selecting tags or entering a movie name. Users select the mode they want from the main menu.

Tags search: Selecting tags mode will search for associated movies based on the tags selected by the user. This interface displays the user's existing search tags and is classified into genres, sub genres, directors, and actors. The interface also displays the current sorting criteria, including ratings and release dates, and remains the default values if it's not changed by the user. The user can choose to add different types of tags, change the sorting criteria, obtain a movie recommendation list based on existing tags, or return to the previous level.

Genres, Sub-genres, Directors, Actors: These interfaces will display a list of tags of a certain type. The user can choose one to add.

Sorting Condition: This interface will display different sorting criteria. The user can change the existing conditions to one of them.

Enter movie name: The entering a movie name model will search for associated movies based on the tags contained in the movie entered by the user. The user can enter the movie name on this interface.

Movie name search: This interface displays the tags and current sorting criteria of the input movie. The user can choose to generate a movie recommendation list based on these tags and current sorting criteria, or they can choose to change the sorting criteria.

Movie list: This interface displays a list of generated movie recommendations.

## Class Diagram
 ![OMT Class Diagram](ImageFiles/Class_Diagram.png)

 The diagram above shows the main classes that will be used in the program. As can be seen by the image, the main calling class will be the MovieMenu calss which wil call the recommender systems by action baseed on user input in the command prompt line. Following this we are planning on using a linked list to store our database of movies through the use of the class "movieList", which contains a Node and data which consists of a movie. The final class we currently plan to use is the Movie class which will hold all the information for each movie. For each movie extracted from the database there will be a title, genre, director, rating, and year of release to allow for sorting by these methods.
 
 > ## Phase III
 > You will need to schedule a check-in for the second scrum meeting with the same reader you had your first scrum meeting with (using Calendly). Your entire team must be present. This meeting will occur on week 8 during lab time.
 
 > BEFORE the meeting you should do the following:
 > * Update your class diagram from Phase II to include any feedback you received from your TA/grader.
 > * Considering the SOLID design principles, reflect back on your class diagram and think about how you can use the SOLID principles to improve your design. You should then update the README.md file by adding the following:
 >   * A new class diagram incorporating your changes after considering the SOLID principles.
 >   * For each update in your class diagram, you must explain in 3-4 sentences:
 >     * What SOLID principle(s) did you apply?
 >     * How did you apply it? i.e. describe the change.
 >     * How did this change help you write better code?
 > * Perform a new sprint plan like you did in Phase II.
 > * You should also make sure that your README file (and Project board) are up-to-date reflecting the current status of your project and the most recent class diagram. Previous versions of the README file should still be visible through your commit history.
 
> During the meeting with your reader you will discuss: 
 > * How effective your last sprint was (each member should talk about what they did)
 > * Any tasks that did not get completed last sprint, and how you took them into consideration for this sprint
 > * Any bugs you've identified and created issues for during the sprint. Do you plan on fixing them in the next sprint or are they lower priority?
 > * What tasks you are planning for this next sprint.

 
 > ## Final deliverable
 > All group members will give a demo to the reader during lab time. ou should schedule your demo on Calendly with the same reader who took your second scrum meeting. The reader will check the demo and the project GitHub repository and ask a few questions to all the team members. 
 > Before the demo, you should do the following:
 > * Complete the sections below (i.e. Screenshots, Installation/Usage, Testing)
 > * Plan one more sprint (that you will not necessarily complete before the end of the quarter). Your In-progress and In-testing columns should be empty (you are not doing more work currently) but your TODO column should have a full sprint plan in it as you have done before. This should include any known bugs (there should be some) or new features you would like to add. These should appear as issues/cards on your Project board.
 > * Make sure your README file and Project board are up-to-date reflecting the current status of your project (e.g. any changes that you have made during the project such as changes to your class diagram). Previous versions should still be visible through your commit history. 
 
 ## Screenshots
 > Screenshots of the input/output after running your application
 ## Installation/Usage
 > Instructions on installing and running your application
 ## Testing
 > How was your project tested/validated? If you used CI, you should have a "build passing" badge in this README.
